退化图像的逆滤波处理

this code provide a matlab program to realize the inverse-filtering described in <Digital Signal processing> By R.C.Gonzalez. This program is based on a 500*500 pixels image which is affected by the atmospheric turbulence whose degradation model is Gaussian or Gaussian like. Two parameter could be changed in the program which is the first float number in the "exp" expression of H(i,j) which determines the variance of the Gaussian or Gaussian like degradation model function----H. The other parameter is threshold which can be find in the code with the same calling. It changes the radii of the processing range of the image.
  
more detailed description of the code can be find in it in chinese.
